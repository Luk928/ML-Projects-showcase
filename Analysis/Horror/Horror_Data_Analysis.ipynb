    "# Horror Movie Data Analysis\n",
    "### Author: Łukasz Ozimek\n",
    "In this project I'll be taking a closer look at data regarding horror movies. I'll answer following questions:\n",
    "1. [What was the number of movies released each month of each year, and the total number of movies were released each year?](#question_1)\n",
    "2. [What was the average horror movie rating, budget and worldwide gross each month, each year, and what's the total average and median?](#question_2)\n",
    "3. [Did horror movies get shorter?](#question_3)\n",
    "4. [Did the amount of jumpscares in movies increase over the years?](#question_4)\n",
    "4. [Did the quality of jumpscares rise?](#question_4.5)\n",
    "5. [Is there a correlation between the IMDB rating and worldwide gross?](#question_5)\n",
    "6. [Is there a correlation between the number of jumpscares and IMDB rating?](#question_6)\n",
    "7. [Does the jumpscare rating affect the IMDB rating, and if so, does accounting for it in conjuction with the jumpscare count allow for better correlation with IMDB rating than jumpscare count alone?](#question_7)\n",
    "8. [Did the public's acceptance of jumpscares decrease over the years?](#question_8)\n",
    "9. [Does the movie's duration and the ratio of jumpscare/duration affect the IMDB rating? Which one is better correlated with the ratings?](#question_9)\n",
    "10. [Does MPAA rating affect the IMDB rating and worldwide gross?](#question_10)\n",
    "11. [What is the list of best rated movies and movies with highest gross values? What about directors?](#question_11)\n",
    "12. [Do the movies that are on Netflix have a higher average IMDB rating and worldwide gross than the movies that aren't?](#question_12)\n",

I also recommend looking at the Tableau project file in this repo, and changing from average to sum or median. You'll see that the median outcome is similar to the average, thus we can conclude that the outliers had little effect on the mean.

We can also see that the budget doesn't seem to be the deciding factor why movies with 22-28 jumpscares seem to break the decreasing trend. It means that even horror movies with large budgets can fail if they have too many jumpscares. Therefore the question regarding why movies with 21-28 jumpscares requires break the trend requires more analysis, and probably more data (for example number of IMDB reviews etc.)\n",
