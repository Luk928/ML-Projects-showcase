# College projects
This folder contains projects I created during a college course on machine learning and neural networks. The course lasted for one term. The course was in Polish language, so each project has a short comment written in Polish. Below is the list of these projects and the aim of each one of them. I can't share the instructions without copyright infringement, therefore they are not included them in this repository. I already had a grasp on machine learning when I signed up for this course, but I wanted to get a better grasp on the theorethical basics.

* Lab1: Machine learning hello world, Anaconda installation and running a classifier prepared by the course instructor.
* Lab2: Creating my own documentation for a list of algorithms. The list of algorithms that were to be documented was created by the course instructor.
* Lab3: Various cross validation types
* Lab4: Statistical hypothesis tests part 1
* Lab5: Statistical hypothesis tests part 2
* Lab6: Linear regression with stochastic gradient descent
* Lab7: Performance metrics
* Lab8: TensorFlow tutorial part 1
* Lab9: TensorFlow tutorial part 2
* Lab10: Creating a functional prediction system that could be used by a radiologist heavily based on [this article.](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10278-018-0079-6.pdf)
