# Twitter sentiment analysis

This project was about creating a script that would train a model on a set of tweets, and then could also be used to use that model to predict the sentiment of tweets with  given hashtag. The outcome is returned in the console.

File list:

* access.csv - csv file with access tokens for Twitter API, the values must be individually placed by users.
* model.tf - a sample model.
* train.csv - file with training tweet data.
* sentiment_analysis.py - the script.
